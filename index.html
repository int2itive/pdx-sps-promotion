            <p>When you throw money at dysfunction, you simply amplify it; it doesn't fix anything. How you think, creates how you feel; how you feel becomes an emotion; an emotion becomes a vibration; the vibration becomes a magnet that attracts things to you...</p>
            <p>Don’t forget to exhale x. A lot of people respond emotionally, and not intellectually. (direction, dimension, intention, aspiration)</p>
            <p>You must recognize that consciousness is power; being aware, knowing something, and being able to do something is what consciousness is all about. This grants power. Remember, we act in terms of what we know, what we believe, what we expect, what we value, what skills we have. All of this is part of consciousness. Therefore, when you manipulate these things, you manipulate people’s ability.
